  "LicensingFAQ": {
    "title": "FAQ",
    "q1": "Is Waydroid suitable for individuals?",
    "a1": "A: Yes, Waydroid public releases are designed to be used to allow Android applications to run on top of a normal Linux environment<br /><br />We offer users multiple types of builds to help fit their needs:<br />- <b>Gapps Builds</b>: Comes with Google Play Store<br />- <b>Vanilla Builds</b>: Comes with no added apps and services. ",
    "q2": "Does Waydroid include proprietary software?",
    "a2": "A:Yes. Our GMS/Gapps releases include proprietary software, and are intended for individuals only, while our Vanilla builds might include some proprietary parts as well. <br /><br />Proprietary redistributables in all Waydroid public builds: <br />- some media codecs (for decoding H.264/HEVC) <br /><br />Extra proprietary redistributables in Waydroid Gapps builds include Google Play Serivces & Google Play Store.",
    "q3": "Is Waydroid suitable for companies?",
    "a3": "A: Yes, but not all builds. We produce vanilla Waydroid builds. While those builds are very basic, they do include much of what would be needed to base a product off of. If your product requires no additional changes on top of what is released to the public, then you are free to use it at no cost.<br />If your product requires Google Apps, ARM/ARM64 Native-Bridge, or Widevine, due to licensing restrictions, we suggest that you <a href=\"mailto:waydroid.project@gmail.com?subject=Development Contract Inquiry\">reach out</a> and we can help you look into alternative options using open-source solutions. <br />",
    "q4": "Can my company use Waydroid with Gapps as-is?",
    "a4": "A: No. The Waydroid versions that include Google Play Store, native-bridge, or widevine are not fit for commercial use or meant to be included in products as they contain proprietary features and services that typically require per-product licensing through Google, Intel, or others. We do however release public Vanilla builds that do not contain any proprietary resources.<br /><br />Most of those proprietary licenses are not eligible for use in generic operating-system setups. Some require the device to pass certification programs that is only meant for single device certifications. For this reason, we do offer open-source alternatives.<br />",
    "q5": "Can my company use Waydroid source-code in a product?",
    "a5": "A: Yes, <b>If you are an individual developer, a startup, or represent some other business enterprise and you are interested in using our sources, the open-source licenses we maintain allow you to use the source at no cost as long as you use it: A) as-is, B) you contribute any changes made back to the source, or C) produce the full source to the public independently.</b> If you would like to use our source and make changes to it that you do not plan on releasing as open-source, we request you contact us to work out a <b>per-device licensing agreement</b> and/or setup a <a href=\"mailto:waydroid.project@gmail.com?subject=Development Contract Inquiry\">development contract</a> for branding, optimizations and specific needs.",
    "q6": "Does my company have to release any changes made to the collective source code of Waydroid?",
    "a6": "A: This all depends on where the changes in the source were made, as many repos in the project retain a different OSS Licenses, there are different requirements per repo. If you are unsure if your company needs to release the source for any of the changes made, please feel free to contact us.<br /><br />Another thing to pay attention to is if the tools being used require the end product or alterations to be released. Some Apache 2.0 licensed projects allow for that requirement to be made. Some versions of Android-Generic Project also have similar licensing requirements. We have put together a toolkit to help identify these types of licenses within the source. You can find that <a href=\"https://github.com/android-generic/agpm-auto-oss-license-documentation\" target=\"_BLANK\">here</a>.",
